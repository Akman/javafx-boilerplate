  // FIELDS

  // To share an object between feature methods declare a @Shared field.
  // Again it’s best to initialize the field right at the point of
  // declaration.
  // Semantically, this is equivalent to initializing the field at the very
  // beginning of the setupSpec() method.
  // Note that setupSpec() and cleanupSpec() may not reference
  // instance fields UNLESS they are annotated with @Shared.

  @Shared
  File propertiesFile = new File(
      getClass().getResource('/test.properties').toURI())

  // Instance fields are a good place to store objects belonging to
  // the specification’s fixture. It is good practice to initialize them
  // right at the point of declaration.
  // Semantically, this is equivalent to initializing them at the very
  // beginning of the setup() method.
  // Objects stored into instance fields are NOT SHARED between feature
  // methods. Instead, every feature method gets its own object.
  // This helps to isolate feature methods from each other, which is often
  // a desirable goal.

  PropertiesMap propertiesMap = new PropertiesMap(propertiesFile)

  // Static fields should only be used for constants.
  // Otherwise shared fields are preferable, because their semantics with
  // respect to sharing are more well-defined.

  // FIXTURE METHODS

  // runs once -  before the FIRST feature method
  // def setupSpec() {
  // }

  // runs before EVERY feature method
  // def setup() {
  // }

  // runs after EVERY feature method
  // def cleanup() {
  // }

  // runs once -  after the LAST feature method
  // def cleanupSpec() {
  // }
