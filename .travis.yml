# Branch value equals:
#   - name of the branch (TRAVIS_BRANCH) for push builds, or builds not
#     triggered by a pull request
#   - name of the branch targeted by the pull request (TRAVIS_BRANCH) for
#     builds triggered by a pull request
#   - name of the tag (TRAVIS_TAG) for builds triggered by a tag
#     CAUTION: For tags, git does not store the branch from which a commit
#     was tagged, so TRAVIS_BRANCH = TRAVIS_TAG

git:

  # Travis CI can clone repositories to a maximum depth of 50 commits,
  # which is only really useful if you are performing git operations.
  # Please note that if you use a depth of 1 and have a queue of jobs,
  # Travis CI won’t build commits that are in the queue when
  # you push a new commit.
  # You can also remove the --depth flag entirely, add depth: false
  
  depth: false

  # Travis CI clones repositories without the quiet flag (-q) by default.
  # Enabling the quiet flag can be useful if you’re trying to avoid
  # log file size limits or even if you just don’t need to include it.

matrix:

  # If some rows in the build matrix are allowed to fail, the build won’t be
  # marked as finished until they have completed. To mark the build as finished
  # as soon as possible, add fast_finish: true
